# Benefit of Generalization
In this lab, generalization was most useful for the creation of the jump function and for the creation of the draw_jack function. It was particularly helpful for the draw-jack function because it meant I didn't have to change as many values as I would have if I had kept copying and pasting the code to create different sized pumpkins.

# Challenges
I wasn't able to keep the stem attached to the pumpkin body. It would be in the correct position for the first pumpkin, but not for the others. I attempted some trial and error, but for some reason, the stems of the second and third pumpkins continued to float.
